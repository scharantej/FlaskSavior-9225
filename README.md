## Flask Application Design for Problem ok

### HTML Files
- **index.html**: This file will serve as the main page of the application and will contain the HTML code for the user interface. It will include Bootstrap components to enhance the layout and responsiveness of the application.
- **result.html**: This file will display the results of any calculations or operations performed by the application. It will also utilize Bootstrap for a consistent user experience.

### Routes
- **route1**: This route will handle the logic for performing the desired calculations or operations. It will process any user input or data provided through HTML forms.
- **route2**: This route will handle the display of the results on the result.html page. It will be responsible for rendering the result.html template with the appropriate data.

### Application Structure
```
├── app.py
├── templates
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── result.html
└── static
```

### Implementation Details
- The `app.py` will contain the Flask application code, including the routes and any backend logic.
- The `templates` folder will hold the HTML files used to render the user interface.
- The `static` folder can be used to store any static resources like CSS or JavaScript files (not covered in the provided design).

### Additional Notes
- The specific details of the calculations or operations performed by the application will depend on the specific problem to be solved.
- The design can be further customized and extended based on the specific requirements of the problem.
